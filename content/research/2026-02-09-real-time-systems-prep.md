## Recent Papers / Topics
- Real-time scheduling under constrained resources
- Deadline and accuracy trade-offs in AI inference workloads
- OS-level real-time considerations for ROS/edge systems

## Current Interests
- How to schedule multiple tasks while preserving real-time guarantees
- How to reason about inference quality under strict deadlines
- How to connect systems theory with practical robotics/inference pipelines

## Notes (Diary)
- I feel my core interest is now clearly in systems under constraints.
- OS and real-time systems classes changed how I define "good" engineering.
- I care less about only building features and more about predictable, efficient behavior.
- Next, I want to convert these questions into measurable experiments.
