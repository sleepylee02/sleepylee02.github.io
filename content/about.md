I am a student at **Yonsei University**, double majoring in **Applied Statistics** and **Computer Science**. 

### 🚀 From Data to Systems
My journey started with statistical modeling. While analyzing large datasets, I became more fascinated by **how** the programs run rather than just the output. I wanted to understand why throughput varies and how to build systems that can handle massive data efficiently. This led me to dive deep into Operating Systems and Distributed Systems.

### 🛠 Experience
- **YBIGTA (Yonsei Big Data Association)** - *Vice President* (2025.06 - 2025.12)
    - *Data Engineering Team Leader* (2025.12 - Present)
- **Yonsei Cycling Club** | Organizer (2024 - 2025)
- **Military Service** | Completed
