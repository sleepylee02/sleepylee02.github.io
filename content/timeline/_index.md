This page explains how my interests evolved and where I am heading next.

## Before University (Early Interest Stage)
- Developed long-term curiosity about building things through club and team activities.
- Built discipline through continuous extracurricular commitments before college.

## 2021: Starting Point
- Entered Yonsei University as an Applied Statistics student.
- Explored different communities and activities while building basic foundations.

## Post-Military Return: Data and Implementation Phase
- Re-entered school and focused on data analysis, machine learning, and implementation-heavy projects.
- Learned how to extract insights from data, but started questioning system-level execution efficiency.
- Shifted focus from only improving model outputs to understanding throughput, latency, and resource usage.

## 2024-2025: Transition to Systems
- Operating Systems and System Programming courses became a major turning point.
- Real-Time Systems coursework introduced a clearer problem frame: limited resources and strict deadlines.
- Interest expanded toward distributed systems, scheduling, and AI serving under constraints.
- Started connecting theory with hands-on implementation experiments.

## Current Stage (2025-2 onward)
- Began Computer Science double major to deepen systems fundamentals.
- Continuing projects in inference serving, cache policy implementation, and ROS-based systems.
- Maintaining a research log around real-time constraints, scheduling, and system efficiency.

## Near Future (2026)
- Build stronger research depth in systems topics and methods.
- Continue toward an MS-focused research path and evaluate PhD direction through lab experience.
- Strengthen project quality with clearer metrics and reproducible experiments.

## Long-Term Direction
- Work on practical AI infrastructure and high-performance serving systems.
- Bridge research ideas with production-grade system architecture.
