## Jaeyoung Lee
Applied Statistics and Computer Science student at Yonsei University, focused on systems performance and architecture.

My path moved from data analysis to system optimization under real-world constraints.

## Current Focus
- Operating systems and distributed systems foundations
- Real-time constraints in AI inference and scheduling
- Efficient AI serving across CPU/GPU resource boundaries
