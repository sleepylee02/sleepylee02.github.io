## Jaeyoung Lee
**Bridging Quantitative Insight and System Implementation.**

My main interest lies in solving problems from the system level and building efficient, reliable architectures for complex projects.

Currently, I am an undergraduate intern at **Yonsei Real-Time Computing Lab**[(RTCL)](https://rtcl-yonsei.github.io/website/index.html). \
