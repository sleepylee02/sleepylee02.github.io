## About Jaeyoung Lee

{{< image src="/profile.jpg" alt="Jaeyoung Lee profile photo" width="220" style="border: none !important; padding: 0 !important; box-shadow: none !important;" >}}

Hello, my name is Jaeyoung Lee. \
I am a student at Yonsei University, 
double majoring in **Applied Statistics** and **Computer Science**.

I started from data analysis, but through studying **Operating Systems** 
and building **infrastructure projects**, I became drawn to solving 
problems at the **system level**.

My current focus is on **real-time systems** — designing and optimizing 
systems under strict resource and deadline constraints.

### How I Think
- **Systems Thinker**: I think about how components fit together
  and *why* they work.
- **Quantitative Lens**: My statistics background shapes how I
  analyze and reason about system behavior.
- **Depth over Breadth**: I follow curiosity widely, but commit
  deeply once I find the right problem.
