## About Jaeyoung Lee

{{< image src="/profile.jpg" alt="Jaeyoung Lee profile photo" width="220" style="border: none !important; padding: 0 !important; box-shadow: none !important;" >}}

I am a student at Yonsei University, 
double majoring in **Applied Statistics** and **Computer Science**.

I started from data analysis, but through studying **Operating Systems** 
and building **infrastructure projects**, I became drawn to solving 
problems at the **system level**.

My current focus is on **real-time systems** — designing and optimizing 
systems under strict resource and deadline constraints.

### Who I Am
- **Depth over Breadth**: I explore widely, but commit deeply 
  once I find the right problem.
- **Systems Thinker**: I care more about *why* something works 
  than *making* it work.
- **Constraint-Driven**: I find motivation in optimizing under 
  strict limits — bounded resources, hard deadlines.
- **Research-Oriented**: I want to understand fundamentals and 
  contribute new ideas, not just ship products.

### Identity
* **Role**: System-oriented engineer with a statistical foundation.
* **Core Philosophy**: Solving challenges at the system level to build robust, performant, and deterministic architectures.
* **Current Affiliation**: Undergraduate Intern at the **Yonsei Real-Time Computing Lab (RTCL)**.
