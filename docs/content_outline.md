# Content Outline

Generated from `docs/content_outline_raw.md` on 2026-02-17.

## 1. Current Goal
- Convert docs/context notes into publish-ready copy for Home/About and a prioritized project list.
- Replace placeholder examples with real content in Projects and Study sections.
- Keep About concise with only short growth context.

## 2. Source Context Inbox
- docs/context/abt myself (portfolio).md
- docs/context/rtcl-meeting-prep.md
- docs/context/prof-contact-email.md

## 2.1 Verified Fact Baseline
- Use verified items from `docs/context_intake.md` (e.g., `F-001` to `F-012`).
- Do not publish unverified statements without owner confirmation.

## 2.2 Provisional Execution Order
1. Finalize Home and About copy from `F-001`, `F-003`, `F-005`.
2. Build two full project pages first from `F-004`, `F-009` (Inference server and S3-FIFO).
3. Add one additional project (ROS2+YOLO or Uber pipeline) after metric availability check.
4. Backfill two recent study logs using `F-010`, `F-011`.

## 3. Mapping Plan (Source -> Target Page)

### Home (`content/_index.md`)
- One-line identity: Applied Statistics + Computer Science student focused on systems performance and architecture.
- Positioning sentence: from data analysis to systems optimization under constraints.
- Current focus candidates: operating systems, distributed systems, efficient AI serving.

### About (`content/about/_index.md`)
- Education: Yonsei University (2021-current), Applied Statistics major + Computer Science double major.
- Keep only concise profile, focus, and key experiences.
- Experience highlights: YBIGTA vice president and data engineering team leadership.

### Projects (`content/projects/`)
- Priority 1: Home inference server setup (DeepSeek operation, 25-1).
- Priority 2: Implementing S3-FIFO cache algorithm (25-1).
- Priority 3: ROS2 + YOLO hazard detection robot system (25-2).
- Backup: Uber data pipeline project (25-W).
- Keep project pages in a common structure: problem, approach, trade-offs, results, lessons.
- Add at least one metric per featured project (latency, throughput, scale, reliability).

### Study (`content/study/`)
- Weekly format: advisor/lab presentation PPT + 3-6 line diary notes.
- Topic stream: real-time scheduling under constrained resources.
- Topic stream: deadline vs accuracy trade-off in AI inference tasks.
- Topic stream: OS-level real-time concerns for ROS and embedded/edge systems.

## 4. Gaps and Questions
- Home featured set currently applied: Inference server, S3-FIFO, ROS2+YOLO.
- Public pages are currently written in English.
- Confirm exact end date for YBIGTA data engineering team leader role (provisional: 2026.06).
- Add concrete metrics to project pages (throughput, latency, reliability) for stronger evidence.

## 5. Private Review Checklist
- Do not publish student ID, private email exchange details, or scheduling logistics.
- Remove lab-internal or non-public implementation details before publishing.

## 6. Done in This Cycle
- [x] Home updated
- [x] About updated
- [x] Projects updated
- [x] Study logs added
