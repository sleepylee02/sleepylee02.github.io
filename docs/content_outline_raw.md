# Content Outline Raw

Free-form scratchpad for incoming ideas.
Write one idea per bullet with a tag, then convert this file into `docs/content_outline.md`.

## Tag Rules
Use this format:
- `[goal]` update-cycle goal
- `[source]` source material location
- `[home]` content for `content/_index.md`
- `[about]` content for `content/about/_index.md`
- `[project]` content for `content/projects/...`
- `[study]` content for `content/study/...`
- `[question]` open questions or missing facts
- `[private]` sensitive items that should not be published

Bullet format:
- `[tag]` one sentence or one fact
